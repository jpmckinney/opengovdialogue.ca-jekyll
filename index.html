        <h2>For better, open government</h2>

        <p>Civil society groups around the world are using the Open Government Partnership process to achieve real gains in transparency, participation and accountability.</p>

        <p>Canada published its <a href="http://open.canada.ca/en/content/third-biennial-plan-open-government-partnership">Third Biennial Plan to the Open Government Partnership (2016-18)</a> in July 2016. The plan includes our proposal to establish a mechanism for ongoing dialogue between the Government of Canada and civil society organizations on open government issues (<a href="http://open.canada.ca/en/content/third-biennial-plan-open-government-partnership#toc5-4-1">Commitment 19</a>).</p>

        <p>We are in discussion with the government to negotiate the details of this ongoing dialogue mechanism. Contact join@opengovdialogue.ca to join the network and receive updates about our progress.</p>
