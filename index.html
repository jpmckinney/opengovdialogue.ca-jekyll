        <p>Civil society groups around the world are using the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">Open Government Partnership</a> process to achieve real gains in transparency, participation and accountability.</p>

The plan <a href="http://open.canada.ca/en/content/third-biennial-plan-open-government-partnership#toc5-4-1">includes our proposal</a> to establish a mechanism for ongoing dialogue between the Government of Canada and civil society organizations on open government issues.</p>
