# Apply to the Multi-stakeholder Forum

The [Canadian Open Government Civil Society Network](http://www.opengovdialogue.ca/) is working with the Canadian government to create a Multi-stakeholder Forum for ongoing dialogue between Government and civil society on open government issues, as part of [Canada’s Third Biennial Plan](http://open.canada.ca/en/content/third-biennial-plan-open-government-partnership#toc5-4) to the [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/).

The Multi-stakeholder Forum will provide input and advice to the government on the development and implementation of open government commitments.  This group will consist of eight civil society representatives, selected through this open application process, as well as four representatives of Canadian government departments involved in open government activities.  At least six stakeholder members must be representatives of not-for-profit organizations registered in Canada.
The Canadian Open Government Civil Society Network is calling for nominations of candidates to fill the eight civil society seats on the Forum.

## Criteria

Stakeholder candidates for the Forum must be able to:

* Engage strategically at the national level, exercising good judgment and engaging effectively with senior government officials and civil society members

* Champion and articulate core open government ideas and values on the national stage, particularly protecting and promoting engagement of civil society
* Participate in and add demonstrable value to in-person and virtual Forum meetings and to the working groups of which they are a member
* Clearly articulate open government issues, and effectively promote open government to the Canadian civil society community

Stakeholder candidates must not be public servants.

Stakeholder candidates should also highlight their experience in civil society and open government issues:

* Experience in at least one area of the Open Government Partnership Declaration (transparency, participation, accountability)

Stakeholder candidates should have the following qualities:

* Ability to dedicate a day a month to the Forum, with intensity increasing around Forum meetings
* Possess skills that can advance a civil society agenda in the context of current open government challenges
* Be a thoughtful, good listener, and well-respected within the national or international civil society or policy communities

## Nomination Process

Candidates may be nominated by a third party or self-nominated.  Candidates may submit their nominations through this website.

Nominations must include:

The applications of short-listed candidates will be uploaded in full to the Forum’s public website.

Nominations of candidates for the Multi-stakeholder Forum will close on October 9.
