# Apply to the Selection Committee

The [Canadian Open Government Civil Society Network](http://www.opengovdialogue.ca/) is working with the Canadian government to create a Multi-stakeholder Forum for ongoing dialogue between government and civil society on open government issues, as part of [Canada’s Third Biennial Plan](http://open.canada.ca/en/content/third-biennial-plan-open-government-partnership#toc5-4) to the [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/).

The Multi-stakeholder Forum will provide input and advice to the government on the development and implementation of open government commitments. This group will consist of eight civil society representatives, selected through an [open application process](/en/apply-multistakeholder-forum.html), as well as four representatives of Canadian government departments involved in open government activities.

The Network’s interim steering committee is seeking individuals to act as Stakeholder Selection Committee members to review candidates nominated for membership to the Multi-stakeholder Forum. Candidates to the Multi-stakeholder Forum will be asked to submit a cover letter, short CV, and a piece of writing or video by the candidate that reflects their thinking and articulation on open government and civil society issues.

Membership on the Stakeholder Selection Committee will involve reviewing the nominations, agreeing with other committee members on a short list, interviewing short-listed candidates, and agreeing on the members of the Multi-stakeholder Forum. Nominations for candidates to the Forum will open the week of September 11th and interviews will take place in October.

To be considered for membership of the Stakeholder Selection Committee, please send a CV and a short letter explaining your motivations and qualifications to serve to [MaryFrancoli@cunet.carleton.ca](mailto:MaryFrancoli@cunet.carleton.ca) and [open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca](mailto:open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca) by September 24.
