Canada is [consulting on its Action Plan on Open Government](http://open.canada.ca/en/consultations/creating-canadas-action-plan-open-government-2016-18). The plan will include specific commitments to improve access to information, civic participation and public accountability.

**You have an opportunity to shape that plan.**

From March 31 to May 15, 2016, Canada is collecting ideas for the plan. You can:

* Read, comment on, and vote up [others' ideas](http://open.canada.ca/en/consultations/help-shape-canadas-action-plan-open-government-2016-18)
* [Submit your own idea](http://open.canada.ca/en/consultations/suggest-new-idea-action-plan-open-government)
* Join an [in-person event](http://open.canada.ca/en/consultations/person-events)
* Send your idea privately to [open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca](mailto:open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca)
